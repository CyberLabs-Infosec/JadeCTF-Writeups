Pearl is eager to throw a party on her birthday. However, she has no contact with Sandeep (no party in ISM is complete without Sandeep), and thus, she calls her friend Jade and asks him to give Sandeep's number. Jade gives her a code in her mail to contact Sandeep. However, her PC crashed & she lost access to all her information. Help her retrieve all her info and the code to contact Sandeep.
